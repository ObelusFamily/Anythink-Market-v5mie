## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

1.  Need to create the clone of the repo "Anything Market Repo"
2.  Download docker and set up to the repo by opening cmd and running the command "docker-compose up"
3.  Then create a user by "http://localhost:3001/register" and check the hit in the docker container.
